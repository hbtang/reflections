How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The command diff shows only the changes between defferent versions of a file.
    So, I can only focus on the changed parts to find the bugs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    The history can help us to understand the program, 
    and it also provide a easy way to go back and start when the recent change is not satisfied.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manually choosing when to commit will be more logical then automatically,
    but need more operations.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    According to different tasks, like in coding we need multiple files to cooperate,
    but in others, like a report file, we don't.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the information of each commit, and git diff shows the changes between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can check out to any previous commit any time.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Version control
